        <p>This roadmap is being created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/sdwig/">Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group</a> with the aim of giving an overview of the features involved in publishing spatial data on the Web. This includes features for capturing, representing, publishing itself, and transformation of spatial data. The features listed have different maturity levels. The roadmap is still in its early stages of creation at the moment. </p>

      <h1>Media Transmission</h1>
      <p>Streamed media content, in particular video, is particularly demanding for the underlying transport as it requires both enough bandwidth and low latency.</p>

        <p data-feature="Adaptive streaming">To ensure the user experience of streamed media remains resilient in face of changing network conditions, media providers make use of adaptive streaming which selects sources of different quality levels based on the networking environment. Several technologies are available to satisfy this approach (such as MPEG DASH) but Web browsers may not offer native support for them. The <a data-featureid="mse">Media Stream Extensions</a> (MSE) specification enables Web application developers to create libraries that will consume these different adaptive streaming formats and protocols.</p>

        <p data-feature="P2P transmission">When broadcasting popular live events on an IP network, it can be beneficial to the broadcaster to spread the load of video distribution by relying on peer-to-peer transmission among watchers. The <a data-featureid="p2p">WebRTC API</a> enables the establishement and utilization of such a peer-to-peer connection, optimized for audio &amp; video transport.</p>

        <h2>Exploratory work</h2>
        <div data-feature="Capabilities and quality">
          <p>To improve the user experience and take advantage of advanced device capabilities when they are available, media providers need to know the decoding (and encoding) capabilities of the user's device. Can the device decode a particular codec at a given resolution, bitrate and framerate? Will the playback be smooth and power efficient? Can the display render HDR and wide color gamut content? The <a data-featureid="media-capabilities">Media Capabilities</a> specification defines an API to expose that information, with a view to replacing the more basic and vague <code>isTypeSupported()</code> and <code>canPlayType()</code> functions defined in HTML.</p>
          <p>Media providers also need some mechanism to assess the user's perceived playback quality to alter the quality of content transmitted using adaptive streaming. The <a data-featureid="media-playback-quality">Media Playback Quality</a> specification, initially part of MSE, exposes metrics on the number of frames that were displayed or dropped.</p>
        </div>
        <p data-feature="Broadcast">Some devices (e.g. TV sets) provide access to non-IP broadcast media; the <a data-featureid="tvtuner">Tuner API in the TV Control specification</a> brings these non-IP media streams to Web browsers. The API also explores ways to expose and launch broadcast-related applications that get transmitted within the transport stream sometimes. The scope of the API may change in the future though. The work on the API itself has been discontinued while scope, use cases and requirements get refined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv">Web and TV Interest Group</a>.</p>
        <p data-feature="Mappings">Different media containers, used to transport media over the network, embed different kinds of in-band tracks, which must be mapped onto video, audio and text tracks in HTML5 so that Web applications can access them interoperably across Web browsers. The <a data-featureid="inband">Sourcing In-band Media Resource Tracks from Media Containers into HTML</a> specification provides such mapping guidelines.</p>

          <dt>Streaming HTTP media on HTTPs pages</dt>
          <dd>While it is possible to read video/audio content served on HTTP in <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements served on HTTPs pages (despite the usual mixed content restrictions), this does not extend to the usage of streaming enabled by Media Stream Extensions. There have been <a href="https://github.com/w3c/media-source/issues/22">early discussions on how this could be solved</a> but the consensus was not to include possible solutions in the current version of the specification.</dd>

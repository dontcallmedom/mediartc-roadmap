      <p>
        The Web platform is under constant evolution. Device implementations and application developers need to share a common understanding of the functionalities that the platform offers at any given point in time, and of recommended guidance to use these powerful features.

        <h2>Exploratory work</h2>
        <p data-feature="Common baseline of the Web platform">The Web Media API Community Group, created under the aegis of the <a href="https://standards.cta.tech/kwspub/wave/">CTA WAVE project</a>, develops the <a data-featureid="webmediaapi">Web Media APIs</a> document, that defines a common baseline of Web technologies that should be included in device implementations to support media Web applications. This document provides an annual snapshot of the Web platform that developers can rely on being supported across devices when they develop media applications.</p>
        <p data-feature="Media Web applications Best Practices">The Community Group also develops the <a data-featureid="webmediaguidelines">Web Media Application Developer Guidelines</a> document, a companion guide to the Web Media APIs specification that outlines best practices and developer guidance for implementing Web media applications.</p>
        <div data-feature="Media production on the Web">
          <p>Professional media assets, including audio-visual masters for television and motion pictures, are increasingly being stored in the cloud. There is a corresponding growing interest in building web applications that allow end-users to manipulate these assets, e.g., quality checking, versioning, timed text authoring, etc. While the web platform has evolved to support consumer media applications, professional applications require additional capabilities, including precise timing, wider color gamut and high-dynamic range, high-fidelity timed text, etc. The Media and Entertainment Interest Group has started to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/media-and-entertainment/media-production/problem-statement">explore the problem space</a>, notably to identify possible technical gaps.</p>

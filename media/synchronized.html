      <h1>Content orchestration</h1>
      <p>In media content, time is of the essence, and when playing media content simultaneously either within a single device or across devices, ensuring that audio, video and other time-based content are properly synchronized is critical to deliver a good user experience.</p>

        <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
        <p data-feature="Timeline management">The basic metronome to use to react to playing media over time is provided by the <a data-featureid="timeupdate"><code>timeupdate</code> event</a> of HTMLâ€™s <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="featureset in-progress">
        <h2>Specifications in progress</h2>
        <p data-feature="Audio synchronization">The <a data-featureid="webaudio">Web Audio API</a> defines a full-fledged audio processing API that exposes the precise time at which audio will be played, exposing the latency introduced by the output pipeline in particular. This allows for very tight synchronization between different audio processing events happening in the local audio context.</p>
        <div data-feature="Close Captioning">
          <p>To associate external text track (e.g. close captions) to to a video, the <a data-featureid="webvtt">Web VTT</a> format can be plugged into a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element.</p>
          <p>While WebVTT is the main format used to render captions in browsers, <a data-featureid="ttml">TTML 2</a> provides a richer language for describing timed text that can be used as an interchange format among authoring systems.</p>
        </div>
        <p data-feature="Timeline management">Beyond text tracks, Web pages may contain many other time-based animations with which synchronization can be useful; the <a data-featureid="webanimations">Web Animations API</a> offers the tools needed to set up these synchronization points.</p>

      <section class="featureset exploratory-work">
        <h2>Exploratory work</h2>
        <p data-feature="Close Captioning">When media resources enclose their own text tracks, having these in-band information exposed to the Web application enables creating richer interactions; the <a data-featureid="inband">Sourcing In-band Media Resource Tracks from Media Containers into HTML</a> document offers guidance as to how that in-band information should be exposed in browsers.</p>
        <p data-feature="Multi-device synchronization">There are a number of cases that need synchronization of several tracks in the same page, for instance to synchronize the sign-language transcript of an audio track with its associated video. The <code>MediaController</code> interface, initially defined in HTML5, was dropped from the HTML specification due to very limited implementation support. The <a data-featureid="timing">Timing Object</a> specification proposes a mechanism to bring shared on-line locks to browsers and ease synchronization of heterogeneous content within a single device and across devices.</p>

          <dt>The <code>MediaController</code> interface</dt>
          <dd>The <code>MediaController</code> interface had been introduced in HTML5 to ease the playback synchronization of different media elements within a single page. The interface was dropped from the HTML5.1 specification due to very limited implementation support and concerns about the performance and technical viability of such solutions on constrained devices.</dd>

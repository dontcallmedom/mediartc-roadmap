          <h3>April 2018</h3>

          <p>The implementation info rendered in tables at the end of each section now embeds information about mobile browsers, and warns when a prefix is required or when a flag must be set to use a feature. Such features are also now consistently flagged as "Experimental" throughout the tables. Implementation information about additional browsers (Baidu, Opera, QQ, Samsung Internet, UC Web) can now be displayed from a dropdown menu. By default, tables will only display information about main browsers (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari), because this information is more up-to-date and reliable (information for other browsers may still be outdated or incorrect in some cases).</p>

          <p>This version also features a series of User Interface improvements to improve the readability and accessibility of the pages.</p>

          <p>Under the hoods, the roadmap framework has been almost entirely re-written to ease Roadmap authoring, and the publication of future snapshots. For instance, the extraction of information about W3C, WHATWG, and IETF specifications should now be automatic in most cases. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-roadmaps#framework-for-web-technology-roadmaps">documentation</a> for details.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>January 2018</h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/01/web-roadmaps/mobile/">January 2018</a> snapshot is a major overhaul of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/08/mobile-web-app-state/">previous mobile roadmap</a>, published until August 2015. Categories have remained vastly intact, but the new version comes with a new lightweight design, and the contents of the pages have been significantly updated to follow the evolution of the Web platform in the past few years.</p>
          <p>The roadmap is published in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Mobile/roadmap/index.html">English</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/Mobile/roadmap/index.zh.html">Chinese</a>.</p>
          <p>Some content may still be missing or incomplete. Among other things, implementation information only targets desktop browsers and is known not to be perfectly correct.</p>

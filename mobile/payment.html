        <h1>Payment and Services</h1>
        <p>Native mobile application stores have made it much easier for developers to monetize some of their applications,
            either by selling the application itself to users, or by providing in-app purchases.</p>

        <p>While Web applications can use well-known on-line payment solutions, these solutions have so far proved much harder
            to use on mobile devices.</p>

            <div data-feature="Web Payment">
                <p>In March 2014, W3C organized a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/">workshop on Web payments</a>                    to identify ways in which standards could help make that payment experience much simpler, in particular
                    on mobile devices. In Octobober 2014, W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/04/payments/webpayments_charter.html">chartered</a>                    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payment Interest Group</a> to drive work in this space,
                    and that group released <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">its sense of priority use cases for Web payments</a>.</p>

                <p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/06/payments-wg-charter.html">charter for a Web Payments Working Group</a>                    is now under review by the W3C Advisory Committee: this group, if chartered, would develop a browser
                    API to facilitate payment operations in Web apps.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, HTML5.1 provides specific help for <strong><a data-featureid="autocomplete-cc">autocomplete of credit card details</a></strong>,
                    making it easier to pay via credit cards once these details have been entered once.</p>

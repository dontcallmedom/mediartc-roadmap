          <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
      <p>The ability to build rich forms with HTML is the basis for user input in most Web-based applications. Due to their limited keyboards, text input on mobile devices remains a difficult task for most users; HTML5 address parts of this problem by offering new type of form controls that optimize the way users will enter data:</p>
      <ul>
<li data-feature="Date and time entries"><strong><a data-featureid="inputdate">date and time entries</a></strong> can take advantage of a number of dedicated form controls (e.g. <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code>) where the user can use a native calendar control;</li>
<li data-feature="Customized text entries (tel, email, url)">the <code><a data-featureid="inputtext">&lt;input type="<strong>email</strong>"&gt;</a></code>, <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/forms.html#telephone-state-(type=tel)">&lt;input type="<strong>tel</strong>"&gt;</a></code> and <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/forms.html#url-state-(type=url)">&lt;input type="<strong>url</strong>"&gt;</a></code> can be used to optimize the ways user enter these often-difficult to type data, e.g. through dedicated virtual keyboards, or by accessing on-device records for these data (from the address book, bookmarks, etc.);</li>
<li data-feature="Input modality">the <code><a data-featureid="inputmode"><strong>inputmode</strong></a></code> attribute (proposed in HTML 5.1) defines the type of textual input expected in a text entry;</li>
<li data-feature="Input pattern">the <code><a data-featureid="inputpattern"><strong>pattern</strong></a></code> attribute allows both to guide user input as well as to avoid server-side validation (which requires a network round-trip) or JavaScript-based validation (which takes up more resources);</li>
<li data-feature="Input hint">the <code><strong><a data-featureid="inputhint">placeholder</a></strong></code> attribute allows to guide user input by inserting hints as to what type of content is expected in a text-entry control;</li>
<li data-feature="Autocomplete for text entries">the <code><a data-featureid="datalist">&lt;datalist&gt;</a></code> element allows creating free-text input controls coming with <strong>pre-defined values</strong> the user can select from; HTML 5.1 defines a mechanism for the <a data-featureid="autocomplete"><code>autocomplete</code> attribute</a> to automatically fill input fields based on <strong>well-known data</strong> for the user.</li>
